The humidity level inside your house is just as important as the temperature. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends keeping the humidity below 65 percent, while the Environmental Protection Agency advises keeping it in a range between 30 and 60 percent.
The project uses the ESP32 Dev board, programmed with the Arduino IDE (Press the boot button while uploading the code).
